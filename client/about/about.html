                <p> This site is intended be a safe haven for those with celiac or gluten intolerances. It is used to take note of and share various gluten-free foods/products available. This includes non-edible products for users who are extra sensitive. Users can share their favorite products by using the "add product" feature. However, products don't always survive the market forever, unfortunately. So, there may be products that are no longer available. Thus, there is a delete feature, to remove these products that are no longer pertinent. Otherwise, this site can also serve as a place to mourn the products we grew to know and love.
