                <p> This site is intended to take note of and share various gluten-free foods/products to know what is available. While there are some products you can buy at your neighborhood grocery store, others may have to be ordered online only--depending on location. It all depends on the lengths those are willing to take. Users can share their favorite products by using the "add product" feature. However, products don't always survive the market forever, unfortunately. So, there may be products that are no longer available. Thus, there is a delete feature, to remove products that are no longer pertinent. <br> Otherwise, we can mourn the products we grew to know and love.
